/* JavaScript allows the use of both single (') and double (") quotes to declare a string. 
  Deciding which one to use generally comes down to personal preference, with some exceptions.
  Having two choices is great when a string has contractions or another piece of text that's in quotes. 
  Just be careful that you don't close the string too early, which causes a syntax error.*/
